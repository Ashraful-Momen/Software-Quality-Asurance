# Instasure Fire Insurance Module - Quality Control Report

## Executive Summary

This quality control report provides a comprehensive assessment of the Instasure Fire Insurance module implemented in Laravel. Testing was conducted over a 6-day period from April 15-21, 2025, covering all major functional areas including quotation processing, order management, policy issuance, and claims handling. The system demonstrates robust implementation of the complete customer journey with appropriate validations, authorizations, and user feedback mechanisms in place. This report details the testing methodology, findings, and recommendations for further improvement before full production deployment.

## Testing Methodology

Testing was conducted according to a structured schedule that systematically evaluated all components and user flows of the fire insurance platform:

3. **Integration Testing**: Verification of cross-component workflows and data consistency
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Validation of system behavior under unusual or extreme conditions
5. **Security Testing**: Assessment of authentication, authorization, and data protection
6. **Performance Testing**: Evaluation of system responsiveness under various load conditions
7. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow validation from quotation to claims processing

All testing was documented with screenshots, and issues were tracked in a centralized spreadsheet for resolution.
